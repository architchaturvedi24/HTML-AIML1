    <h3>Trees in Amazon rainforest growing bigger, adapting to CO2 in atmosphere</h3>
    <p>The growth of the trees, the researchers warned, is "increasingly critical for the trajectory of the net carbon balance" in the Amazon region.</p>

    <p>An aerial view shows trees as the sun rises at the Amazon rainforest in Manaus</p>
    <p>The trees across the Amazon rainforest have grown larger over the past 30 years, once again highlighting how the vast rainforest, often tasked to play the role of the planet's carbon sink, has a vital role to play against climate change.

The unusual pattern observed in the forest has been attributed to the rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere and an imporved availability of resources.</p>
    <p>The observations and conclusions were the work of a new extensive study, titled Increasing tree size across Amazonia, published this week in Nature Plants journal.

According to the study, the tree sizes have grown 3.2 per cent every decade, consistent with the rise in CO2.</p>
